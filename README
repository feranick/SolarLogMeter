Arduino sketch for a Log Meter device for solar PV measurements.

Required Library: Real Time Clock:
https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib

Requires Arduino MEGA 2560 or better (AVR) or Arduino DUE.
Initial support for Arduino Intel-based boards is included, but largely untested.

Features (if proper hardware is available):
- Simultaneous acquisition of up to 4 solar cell systems  
- Real time clock
- Extraction of relevant parameters based on IV curve
- Support for serial display or automatic acquisition.
- Support for saving data on SD card.
- Customizable configuration file.
- Support for temperature (via IC or thermistor) and barometric pressure
- Support for irradiance monitor
- Automatically computes and saves sun position
