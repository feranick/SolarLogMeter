Version 3.7 - 20160509 - Minor changes to copyright and initial guide

Version 3.6 - 20151019 - Fixed resolution issues in analog input with Arduino DUE.

Version 3.5 - 20151010 - Now compiles correctly on the Arduino Intel-based boards. Just enable the correct flag. Analog input resolution on ARM-based Arduinos is now set to 12bit (compared to 10bit of AVR-based boards).

Version 3.4 - 20150722 - Added info on how to compile with correct RTClib support for Arduino Intel-based boards.

Version 3.3 - 20150722 - Improved compatibility with ARM32 and Intel boards. Now each ARM32 (boards Due and Zero) and Intel (Edison and Galileo) have their own flags.

Version 3.2 - 20150721 - Added info on how to compile with SD support for Mega with IDE 1.6.x. Minor bug fixes.

Version 3.1 - 20150720 - Updated pins for barometric sensor.

Version 3.0 - 20150720 - Rest time can now be expressed in either secs or minutes in the config file in the SD card.

Version 2.6 - 20141120: Several bug fixes on Voc, Isc measurements. Reformatted time/date for better integration with MatLab.  

Version 2.4 - 20141030: Added option (flag in SD) to automatically start acquisition at boot. Minor bug fixes.

Version 2.3 - 20141023: Introduced SPI clock divider to slow signal transmission to DAC through protecting diodes.

Version 2.2 - 20141022: Cleanup of current variables. Current variables are defined immediately as such after acquisition, no through their voltage (and conversion later).

Version 2.1 - 20141022: Introduced soft parameter for current offset (itâ€™s saved as the second parameter in SD cards). Warning: the SLM.CFG needs to be updated for this version (or removed, a new one is created automatically).

Version 2.0.2 - 20141017: Optimized DAC parameters.

Version 2.0.1 - 20141008: Starts reading from analog port 0 (rather than 8) for better integration with PCB.

Version 2.0 - 20141001: Minor fix in RTClib

Version 2.0 - 20140929: Stable Release

Version 1.102.1 - 20140828: Included support for Arduino Due.

Version 1.101.1 - 20140827: Bug fixes. Voltage applied is now reset at the end of a sweep.

Version 1.100.1 - 20140823: Bug fixes and code cleanup. Improved variable initialization. 

Version 1.99.1 - 20140822: Added support for multiple amplification resistors to extend range of testable devices. Bug fixes.

Version 1.97.2 - 20140818: Completely rewritten. New IV acquisition based on IVy

New stable is: v 1.97.2


==========================  END of LIFE v. 0.15 ==========================

Version 0.15 - 20120402: Added support for Arduino Ethernet Shield (with SD). Recompilation is necessary (along with changes in the header files and definition variables).

Version 0.14 - 20120326: Arduino IDE 1.0 is the default supported platform. IDE v.0.22 no longer supported. Added sun position calculator based on real time time/date and customizable location. 

Version 0.11 - 20111031: Stabilized version based on 0.10, ready for production. Introduced debugging symbols and procedures. It can currently handle 3 6-pots + 4 fix resistors per cell.

Version 0.10 - 20111020: Initial implementation of multi potentiometer to scale resistance to low value. This version has been used mainly for testing.

Version 0.9.8 - 20111011: Temporary fix with issue about filename 
(October date make SLM hang). The fix changes the names of the files for 
individual cells from dates to SC.

Version 0.9.7 - 20110930: First release on GitHub
