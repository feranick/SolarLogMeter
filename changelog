==========================  END of LIFE v. 0.15 ==========================

Version 0.15 - 20120402: Added support for Arduino Ethernet Shield (with SD). Recompilation is necessary (along with changes in the header files and definition variables).

Version 0.14 - 20120326: Arduino IDE 1.0 is the default supported platform. IDE v.0.22 no longer supported. Added sun position calculator based on real time time/date and customizable location. 

Version 0.11 - 20111031: Stabilized version based on 0.10, ready for production. Introduced debugging symbols and procedures. It can currently handle 3 6-pots + 4 fix resistors per cell.

Version 0.10 - 20111020: Initial implementation of multi potentiometer to scale resistance to low value. This version has been used mainly for testing.

Version 0.9.8 - 20111011: Temporary fix with issue about filename 
(October date make SLM hang). The fix changes the names of the files for 
individual cells from dates to SC.
